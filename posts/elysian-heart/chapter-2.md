The world didn’t end when the astronaut fell — but it didn’t stay the same either.

It shifted.

Mountains whispered ancient names as fault lines pulsed beneath their roots. Oceans grew restless, tides rising higher than charts had ever predicted. But no one could see the true shift — the one inside people.

In Ilaya, Varen sat cross-legged on the roof of his aunt’s hut, staring at his palm. Hours ago, he had crushed a stone just by clenching his fist.

“Maybe it was weak,” he whispered to himself. “Maybe I’m still me.”

But deep down, he knew something fundamental had changed. Something was waking up.

In cities across the world — Neo Kyro in the east, Valdris in the north, Saphirra in the desert south — news of superhuman strength, agility, and healing spread like wildfire. Some celebrated. Others panicked. Governments whispered of lockdowns. Scientists scrambled for answers.

In Kaltara, Zeren laughed as he jumped from one icy cliff to another, landing without effort. “I’m a god now,” he said. His brother Zekiel didn’t reply. He stared at the frozen lake below them.

“…You think power makes you a god?” Zekiel muttered. “It makes you a target.”

Their foster father — a hard man with a scar that split his face — watched from behind the window. He didn’t smile. He only muttered, “They’ll come for him soon.”

Meanwhile, hidden beneath the ruins of a burnt-down orphanage in Eastern D'remah, a group of survivors huddled together. One of them, a girl named Leina, whispered, “It’s not just strength. It’s like… the Earth gave us what we lacked.”

They didn’t know why. Not yet. But something had rewritten the rules of human existence.

Back in Ilaya, Varen helped a cart stuck in the mud. One lift — effortless. The villagers clapped. He grinned.

But behind the applause, fear was growing. Not just fear of power… but fear of what people would do with it.
