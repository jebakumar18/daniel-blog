The sky cracked.

It wasn’t thunder, nor lightning. It wasn’t even the wrath of a storm. It was something different..... A streak of silver fire tore through the clouds, cutting across the heavens like a divine blade. The world paused. Children on the streets stopped playing. Farmers in the fields dropped their tools. Priests forgot their prayers mid-chant. All eyes turned upward.

And then it fell.

A body, wrapped in a suit not of this world, slammed into the Earth. The ground screamed. Trees bowed. Cities blinked. Mountains trembled.

No one knew who he was. Or what he brought.

But that day, the planet changed forever.

On the same time, in a quiet village called Ilaya, nestled between green hills and forgotten time, a boy named Varen was chasing chickens barefoot. He was sixteen, a bit lanky, always smiling, and oddly curious about everything. People in the village called him “The Question Machine.”

“Why do birds fly, Ma?”
“Why does the sun disappear?”
“Why do we cry when we’re happy?”

He never fought. He never yelled. He believed everyone—even the cruel ones—could still choose to be kind.

That night, as the stars flickered nervously, Varen looked up and whispered to the heavens, “What was that light?”

A new ache stirred in his chest.

He didn’t know yet that he, too, had changed. That every living human had.

The astronaut, long forgotten by the stars, had brought something with him—a cosmic virus made of light. It didn’t kill. It awakened. Buried deep in human cells, like a seed waiting for strange rain.

And rain it did.

In Ilaya, a man lifted an ox cart with one hand and fainted from shock.
In distant Metrelon City, a street girl dodged bullets by blinking—literally—from one place to another.
In the Sky District, nobles grew wings.

The world called it The Strength Bloom.

No one understood it fully. But everyone felt it.

Far away in the frozen north, inside a colossal floating fortress, a man in crimson robes watched the sky crack with interest. Beside him stood a boy—maybe fifteen, eyes too innocent for the place he stood.

The man said, “That one, the elder twin from Kaltara… he will be something. Perhaps… the King this world never asked for.”

His right-hand man nodded.

The boy, Zeren, had no idea he’d just been marked by fate.

In Ilaya, Varen slept under the stars, dreaming of flying.

But across the planet, his dream had just collided with someone else’s nightmare.
