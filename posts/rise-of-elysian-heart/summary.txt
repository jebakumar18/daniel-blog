After an astronaut crashes to Earth, the planet undergoes a supernatural shift — awakening powers in humans across the globe. Strength, speed, and destruction flow freely, but so does chaos. In a humble village, a boy named Varen chooses kindness and mercy, even when the world turns cruel. Far across the icefields of Kaltara, Zekiel, a boy with the same past, chooses domination and control. As their destinies twist, they become two sides of the same wound. The story set in an imaginary Earth with cities like Neo Kyro, Saphirra, Valdris, and Westvale.

In the end, Varen doesn’t just fight evil — he tries to change the meaning of power itself. A hero isn’t born. A hero is chosen. By choice. By pain. By heart.
🔥 Action. 😢 Pain. 😂 Humor. 💔 Loss. ❤️ Hope.
